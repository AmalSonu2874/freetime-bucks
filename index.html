                <h4>1. BREADTH FIRST SEARCH.</h4>
                <br>
                <h4>Breadth first search is the most common search strategy for traversing a tree or a graph .This
                  algorithm
                  searches breadth wise in a tree or graph , So it is called breadth first search.</h4>
                <li>BFS algorithm starts searching from the root node of the tree and expands all success or node at the
                  current
                  level before moving to nodes of the next level.</li>
                <li>The breadth -first search algorithm is an example of a general - graph search algorithm </li>
                <li>Breadth-first search implemented using FIFO queue data structure. </li>

                <br>
                <h4>ADVANTAGES :</h4>
                <lI>BFS will provide a solution if any solution exists</lI>
                <li>If there are more than one solutions for a given problem , then bfs wil provide the minimal solution
                  which
                  requires the least numbe rof steps.</li>
                <li>It also helps in finding the shortest path in goal state , since it needs all nodes at the same
                  hierarchical
                  level before making a move to nodes at lower levels.</li>
                <li>It is also very easy to comprehended with the help of this we can assign the higher rank among path
                  types.
                </li>
                <br>
                <h4>DISADVANTAGES :</h4>
                <li>It requires lots of memory</li>
                <li>It requires lots of time</li>
                <li>It can be very inefficient approach for searching through deeply layered spaces.</li> <br>
                <h4>Time Complexity :-
                  Time complexity of BFS can be obtained by the number of not travels in BFS until the shallowest node .
                  <li> d = depth of shallowest
                  <li> b = node at every state <br>
                    T(b) = 1+b^2 + b^3 ................ + b^d = 0(b^d)
                </h4>
                <br>
                <h4>Space Complexity :- Space complexity of BFS is given by memory size of Frontier which is O(b^d)</h4>

                  <li> It is called the depth-first search because it Starts from the root node and follows each path to
                    its
                    greatest depth node before. moving to the next path. </li>
                  <li> DFS uses a stack data structure for its implementation</li>
                  <li>The process of the DFS agoristim is similar to the BFs algorithm. </li> <br>

                <h4>ADVANTAGES : </h4>
                <li> DFS requires less memory as it only needs to store a stack of the nodes on the path from root node
                  to the
                  current mode. </li>
                <li> It takes less time to reach to the goal mode than BFS algorithm (if it traverses in the right path)
                </li>
                <li> With the help of this we can stordes the route Which is being tracked in memory to save time as it
                  only
                  needs to keep one at a particular time. </li><br>
                <h4>DIS ADVANTAGES : </h4>
                <li>There is the possibility that Keep re-occuring, and there is no gurantee of finding the solution.
                </li>
                <li> DFS algorithm goes for deep down searching and sometime it may go to the infinite loop. </li>
                <li> The depth first search (DFS) algorithm does not always find the shortest path to a solution </li>

              <h5> A depth limited search is similar to DFS with a predetermined limit. DLS search can solve the
                drawback of the infinite path In DFS. </h5>
              <h5>DLS Can bo terminated with 2 conditions of fail. </h5>
              <li> Standard failure value : it. indicates that Prodem does not have any Solution. </li>
              <li>Cut off failure value : It defines no sdeltion for the problem within a given depth limit. </li>

              <h4>5. UNIFORM COST SEARCH </h4> <br>
              <li> Uniform Cost Search is a searching algorithms used for traversing a weighted tree or graph this
                algorithm Comes into play when a different cost is available for each edge. The primary goal of
                the uniform-cost search is to find a path to the goal node which has the lowest cumulative cost.
                Uniforms cost Search expands nodes according to their path. costs from the root mode. It can be
                used to solve any graph/ tree where the optimal cost is in demand. A uniform-cost search algorithm
                is implemented by the priority queue. It gives maximum priority to the lowest cumulative cost.
                Uniform cost Search is equivalent to BTS algorithm if the path Cost of all edges is the same.

            SUMMARY
            <br>
            <br>
            This can give you a brief summary about the talk by shashi taroor at oxford university.
            <br>
            <li>Tharoor cites Indiaâ€™s economic decline from 23% to below 4% of global trade during British rule.</li>
            <li> The British exploited India for resources, financing their Industrial Revolution at Indiaâ€™s expense.
            </li>
            <li>Colonial policies dismantled Indiaâ€™s textile industry, leaving weavers impoverished.</li>
            <li> Reparations principles are likened to other historical precedents, such as Germanyâ€™s reparations
              post-WWII.</li>
            <li>Starvation in India, exacerbated by British policies during famines, illustrates colonial neglect.</li>
            <li>British infrastructure was built primarily for colonial interests, not local benefits.</li>
            <li>The acknowledgment of historical wrongs is essential for reconciliation and reparations. </li>
            <br>
            KEY INSIGHTS
            <br>
            <br>
            <li> Colonial Economic Impact: Tharoor illustrates how British colonialism drastically reduced Indiaâ€™s
              economic power, transforming it from a leading exporter to an impoverished nation. This underscores the
              long-lasting effects of exploitation. </li>
            <li>Deindustrialization: The dismantling of Indiaâ€™s textile industry highlights how colonial policies were
              designed to benefit Britain rather than the local economy, leading to widespread poverty among skilled
              artisans. </li>
            <li>Moral Responsibility: Tharoor emphasizes that acknowledging historical injustices is a moral obligation,
              advocating for reparations not just as financial compensation but as recognition of past wrongs.</li>
            <li>Global Context: He draws parallels with other nations that have received reparations, reinforcing that
              such actions are not unprecedented and can promote healing and accountability.</li>
            <li>Human Cost of Colonialism: The reference to famines and starvation illustrates the human suffering
              caused by colonial policies, challenging the narrative of benevolent governance.</li>
            <li> Infrastructure Misuse: The argument that railways were built for British benefit rather than Indian
              needs reveals the exploitative nature of colonial investments, questioning the legacy often celebrated by
              former colonizers.</li>
            <li> Long-term Consequences: Tharoorâ€™s insights reflect on how colonialism has shaped contemporary issues in
              post-colonial societies, suggesting that reparations could aid in addressing these deep-rooted challenges.

                  SUMMARY
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <li>The writer sought to understand the connection between India's past and present.</li>
                  <li>The present state of India is described as a mix of medievalism, poverty, misery, and superficial
                    modernism.</li>
                  <li>The middle class felt restricted under British rule and desired growth and development.</li>
                  <li>There was a spirit of revolt against British rule, but the middle class sought to retain and
                    control the existing structure rather than challenge or uproot it.</li>
                  <li>The author avoids idealizing the masses and sees the people of India as individuals, not as a
                    theoretical abstraction.</li>
                  <li>They found more in the people of India than they had expected, attributing their potential
                    strength to the retention of the old Indian cultural tradition</li>
                  <li>Despite the battering received over the past two hundred years, something worthwhile remains along
                    with much that is worthless and evil.</li>
                  <li>The author extensively traveled through the towns and villages of the United Provinces of Agra and
                    Oudh during the 1920s, getting to know the people and their way of life.</li>
                  <li>The area was considered the heart of Hindustan and had a rich history of ancient and medieval
                    civilization, as well as being the site of the great revolt of 1857.</li>
                  <li>In the 1930s, the author extensively traveled throughout India, engaging with political and
                    economic issues during the election campaign of 1936-37.</li>
                  <li>Despite being involved in politics, the author was drawn to a deeper fascination with the land and
                    people of India.</li>
                  <li>The author struggled to fully comprehend the depth of India's culture and history, describing it
                    as a complex and mysterious personality.</li>
                  <li>Despite the outward diversity, the author was struck by the unity that had held the people of
                    India together throughout history, making it an emotional experience rather than just an
                    intellectual concept.</li>
                  <li>The author acknowledges the diverse aspects of Indian life, including classes, castes, religions,
                    and races.</li>
                  <li>Despite the diversity, the author believes that a country with a long cultural background and a
                    common outlook on life develops a unique spirit that influences all its inhabitants.</li>
                  <li>The author's curiosity about this spirit is driven by a desire to gain insight into their own
                    country and people.</li>
                  <li>While acknowledging the daily distractions of politics and elections, the author emphasizes the
                    importance of understanding the deep foundations necessary to build India's future.</li>

          <p>
            R can be used like a basic calculator for arithmetic operations.
            Common Arithmetic Operations:
            <li>Addition (+)</li>
            <li>Subtraction (-)</li>
            <li>Multiplication (*)</li>
            <li>Division (/)</li>
            <li>Exponentiation (^)</li>
            <li>Modulo (%%) to find the remainder</li>
            <li>Integer Division (%/%) for division without decimals</li>
            <br>
            Assigning Values to Variables
            <br>
            " You can store values in variables using the assignment operator <-. "
          * Example:  # Assigning values :-
          " x <- 5 , y <- 10 "
          <br>
          Mathematical Functions
          <br>
          <li>sqrt(x): Square root of x</li>
          <li>log(x): Natural logarithm of x</li>
          <li>exp(x): Exponential function (e^x)</li>
          <li>sin(x), cos(x), tan(x): Trigonometric functions</li>
          <li>abs(x): Absolute value of x</li>
          <br>
          Working with Vectors
            <br>
            A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same type. You can create vectors using the 
            c() function.
            <br>
            # Creating a vector
            vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) <br>
            # Accessing elements
            vec[1] # First element
            vec[3] # Third element
            <li>length(vec): Returns the number of elements in the vector. </li>
            <li>sum(vec): Adds all elements of the vector.</li>
            <br>
            Working with Matrices
            <br>
            A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure with rows and columns. You can create 
            matrices using the matrix() function.
            <br>
            # Create a 2x3 matrix (2 rows, 3 columns)
            mat <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
            <br>
            # Accessing elements
            mat[1, 2] # Element in the 1st row, 2nd column
            <br>
            Logical Operators and Comparisons
            <br>
            Logical operators help in making comparisons and are often used in conditional statements.
            <li>x <- 10</li>
            <li>y <- 20</li>
            <li>x > y # Greater than</li>
            <li>x < y # Less than</li>
            <li>x == y # Equal to</li>
            <li> x != y # Not equal to</li>
            <li>x >= 5 && y <= 30 # AND condition</li>
            <li>x == 10 || y == 15 # OR condition</li>
            # Accessing elements from a vector
            * vec <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
            * vec[1] # First element
            * vec[2:4] # Elements from index 2 to 4
            * # Accessing elements from a matrix
            * mat <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
            <br>
            Sequence Generation
            <br>
            R provides functions like seq() and rep() to generate sequences and repeat values.
            <li>seq(1, 10, by = 2) # Sequence from 1 to 10, increment by 2</li>
            <li>rep(3, times = 5) # Repeat the number 3, 5 times</li>
            <br>
            Basic Data Types in R
            <br>
            R supports different data types such as numeric, character, and logical. You can check the 
            type using class() or typeof().
            <li>x <- 5 # Numeric</li>
            <li> y <- " Hello" # Character</li>
              <li> z <- TRUE # Logical</li>
              <li>class(x) # Find the data type of x</li>
              <li>typeof(y) # Another way to check the data type</li>
          </p>

          <h4>What are Aerosols ? </h4>
          <li>1. Dust: Dust is produced by the crushing, grinding and natural sources like windstorms.Generally the dust
            particles are over 20 micron in diameter.
            They do not flocculate but settle under gravity, but smaller particles like 5 micron form stable
            suspensions.</li>
          <li>2. Smoke: Smoke is made up of finely divided particles produced by incomplete combustion.
            Generally it consists of carbon particles of size less than 1.0 micron.</li>
          <li>3. Mists: Mist is a light dispersion of minute water droplets suspended in the atmosphere ranging from 40
            to 400 micron in size.</li>
          <li>4.Fumes: Fumes are solid particles generated by condensation from the gaseous state after volatilization
            from melted substances. Fumes flocculate and sometimes coalesce.</li>
          <li>5.Fog: Fog is made up of dispersion of water or ice near the earthâ€™s surface reducing visibility to less
            than 500 m. In natural fog the size of particles range from 1.0 to 40 micron.</li>
          <br>
          <h4>Define Particulate Pollutants .</h4>
          <li>Particulate Matter (PM) - Particulates created from gaseous primary pollutants and compounds in
            photochemical smog.</li>
          <li>PM is one of the most important pollutants as it
            penetrates into sensitive regions of the respiratory
            system</li>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Primary Particulate Matter</th>
              <th>Secondary Particulate Matter</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Primary PM is the fraction of PM that is emitted directly
                into the atmosphere.</td>
              <td>Secondary PM forms in the
                atmosphere following the oxidation and transformation
                of toxic gases. </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <li>Wide variety of airborne material. PM pollution
            consists of materials (including dust, smoke, and soot), that are directly emitted into the air or result
            from the transformation of gaseous pollutants. Particles come from natural sources (e.g., volcanic
            eruptions) and human activities such as burning fossil fuels, incinerating wastes.</li>
          <li>Coal grinding, fugitive road dust and dust from rock quarries are examples of physical processes that
            release particulate matter to the atmosphere.</li>
          <li>PM formed through chemical reactions are typically much smaller (<10 mm diameter) . Chemical processes
              that release particulate matter to the atmosphere include all forms of combustion.</li>
              <br>
              <h4>What are the Health Effects of Particulate Matters ?</h4>
          <li>Respiratory Issues: Aggravated asthma, decreased lung function, and increased respiratory symptoms like
            coughing and difficulty breathing.</li>
          <li>Cardiovascular Problems: Nonfatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, and premature death in people with
            heart or lung disease.</li>
          <li>Vulnerable Populations: Children, older adults, and individuals with preexisting heart or lung conditions
            are particularly at risk.</li>
          <br>
          <h4>Electrostatic Precipitator</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            The working principle of the electrostatic precipitator is moderately simple. It consists of two sets of
            electrodes: positive and negative. The negative electrodes are in the form of a wire mesh, and the positive
            electrodes are plates. The gas borne particles such as ash are ionised by the high voltage discharge
            electrode by the corona effect. These particles are ionised to a negative charge and are attracted to
            positively charged collector plates. Electrostatic Precipitator or ESP is an equipments which uses high
            intensity Electric Field to capture the dust particles.

          <h4>Bag Filter</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            The "working principle" of a bag filter is based on the filtration of particulate matter from a gas stream.
            The gas stream enters the filter and flows through a series of bags. The bags are made of a filter media,
            such as polyester, nylon, or glass fiber, that has small pores that trap the particles.The particles are
            captured on the surface of the bags, and the clean gas flows out of the filter.The bags are then cleaned
            periodically to remove the captured particles.
            <br>
            There are two main methods for cleaning bag filters:
            <li>Shaker cleaning: In shaker cleaning, the bags are shaken to is lodge the captured particles. This is a
              simple and effective method, but it can be noisy.</li>
            <li>Pulse jet cleaning: In pulse jet cleaning, a short burst of compressed air is directed into the bags.
              This dislodges the captured particles and blows them into a hopper at the bottom of the filter.Pulse jet
              cleaning is more effective than shaker cleaning, but it is also more expensive.</li>
          </p>

          <h4>Cyclone Separators</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            Cyclone separators work much like a centrifuge, but with a continuous feed of dirty air. In a cyclone
            separator, dirty flue gas is fed into a chamber. The inside of the chamber creates a spiral vortex, similar
            to a tornado. The lighter components of this gas have less inertia, so it is easier for them to be
            influenced by the vortex and travel up it. Contrarily, larger components of particulate matter have more
            inertia and are not as easily influenced by the vortex.
          </p>

          <h4>Air Pollutant Gases.</h4>
          <br>
          <li>Sulphur dioxide:</li>
          <li>Oxides of nitrogen:</li>
          <li>Carbon monoxide:</li>
          <li>Hydrogen fluoride:</li>
          <li>Ozone:</li>
          <br>
          <h4>Absorber</h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            In the context of air pollution control, absorption involves the transfer of a gaseous pollutant from the
            air into a contacting liquid, such as water.The liquid must be able either to serve as a solvent for the
            pollutant or to capture it by means of a chemical reaction.
            <br>
            Wet scrubbers and packed scrubbers :
            <br>
            <li>Wet scrubbers similar to those described above for controlling suspended particulates may be used for
              gas absorption. Gas absorption can also be carried out in packed scrubbers, or towers, in
              which the liquid is present on a wetted surface rather than as droplets suspended in the air.</li>
            <li>A common type of packed scrubber is the countercurrent tower. After entering the bottom of the tower,
              the polluted airstream flows
              upward through a wetted column of light, chemically inactive packing material.
            </li>
            <li>The liquid absorbent flows downward and is uniformly spread throughout the column packing, thereby
              increasing the total area of contact between gas and liquid.</li>
            <br>
            Flue gas desulfurization (FGD)
            <br>
            Sulfur dioxide in flue gas from fossil-fuel power plants can be controlled by means of an absorption process
            called flue gas desulfurization (FGD).FGD systems may involve wet scrubbing or dry scrubbing. In wet FGD
            systems, flue gases are brought in contact with an
            absorbent, which can be either a liquid or a slurry of solid material.

          <h4>Catalytic Convertor</h4>
          <br>
          <li>catalytic converter, in automobiles, a component of
            emission control systems used to reduce the discharge
            of noxious and polluting gases from the internal-
            combustion engine.</li>
          <li>The catalytic converter consists of an insulated chamber
            containing a honeycomb structure or pellets coated with
            catalyst through which the exhaust gases are passed.</li>
          <li>Hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust are
            oxidized to water vapour and carbon dioxide, and
            nitrogen oxides are reduced to nitrogen and oxygen.</li>
