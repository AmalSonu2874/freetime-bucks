      <h3 id="search">SEARCH ALGORITHMS</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>SEARCHING : It is a step-by-step procedure to solve a search problem in agiven search space factors of search
        problems are :</h4>
      <li>SEARCH SPACE : It represents all the possible path which system may have.</li>
      <li>START STATE : It is a state from where agent begins the search.</li>
      <li>GOAL TEST : It is a function that observes the current state and return whether the goal state is achieved or
        not . </li>
      <br>
      <h4>SOME BASIC KEYWORDS : </h4>
      <lI>SEARCH TREE : Tree representation of search problems is called search tree . Thr root of search tree . The
        root of search tree is the root node which corresponding to the initial state. </lI>
      <li>ACTIONS : It gives the description of all the available actions to the agent.</li>
      <li>PATH COST : It is a function that assign numeric cost to each path.</li>
      <li>TRANSITION MODEL : A description of what each action do , can be represented to transiton model.</li>
      <li>SOLUTION : It is an action sequence which leads fro the srart node to the goal node.</li>
      <li>OPTIMAL SOLUTION : If a solution has the lowest cost among all solutions.</li>
      <br>
      <h4>EVALUATION METRICS / PROPERTIES OF SEARCH.</h4>
      <li>Completeness - A search algorithms is said to be complete of it guarantees to return a solution if at least
        any solution exists for any random input.</li>
      <li>Optimality - If a solution found for an algorithms is guaranteed to be the best solution (lowest path cost)
        among all other solutions then such as solution for is said to be optimal solution.</li>
      <li>Time Complexity - Time complexity is a measure of time for an algorithms to complete its task.</li>
      <li>Space Complexity - Maximum storage soace is required at any point during the search as complexity of problem .
      </li>

        <br>
        <h4 style="font-size: 2rem; color: #eda423;">1. BREADTH FIRST SEARCH.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>Breadth first search is the most common search strategy for traversing a tree or a graph .This algorithm
          searches breadth wise in a tree or graph , So it is called breadth first search.</h4>
        <li>BFS algorithm starts searching from the root node of the tree and expands all success or node at the current
          level before moving to nodes of the next level.</li>
        <li>The breadth -first search algorithm is an example of a general - graph search algorithm </li>
        <li>Breadth-first search implemented using FIFO queue data structure. </li>
        <br>
        <h4 style="color: #f91e1e;">PROCESS FLOW OF BFS : <a
            href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.guru99.com%2Fbreadth-first-search-bfs-graph-example.html&psig=AOvVaw2jDsQeallemnsyvtMj0q9v&ust=1725264687250000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCIjEx_iloYgDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAJ"
            style="color:#eda423; font-size: large;"><i class='bx bx-images' style="font-size: x-large;"></i></a></h4>
        <br>
        <h4>ADVANTAGES :</h4>
        <lI>BFS will provide a solution if any solution exists</lI>
        <li>If there are more than one solutions for a given problem , then bfs wil provide the minimal solution which
          requires the least numbe rof steps.</li>
        <li>It also helps in finding the shortest path in goal state , since it needs all nodes at the same hierarchical
          level before making a move to nodes at lower levels.</li>
        <li>It is also very easy to comprehended with the help of this we can assign the higher rank among path types.
        </li>
        <br>
        <h4>DISADVANTAGES :</h4>
        <li>It requires lots of memory</li>
        <li>It requires lots of time</li>
        <li></li>
        <h4>Time Complexity :- </h4>

        <h4>It is a type of Uninformed / Blind . </h4>
        <br>
        <h4 style="font-size: 2rem; color: #eda423;">2.DEPTH FIRST SEARCH.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4> Depth first search is a recursive algorithm. for traversing a tree or graph data Structure </h5> <br>
        <li> It is called the depth-first search because it Starts from the root node and follows each path to its
          greatest depth node before. moving to the next path. </li>
        <li> DFS uses a stack data structure for its implementation</li>
        <li>The process of the DFS agoristim is similar to the BFs algorithm. </li> <br>
        <h5>Note: Back tracking is an algorithm technique it for finding all possible solutions using recursion
        </h4><br>
        <h4>ADVANTAGES : </h4>
        <li> DFS requires less memory as it only needs to store a stack of the nodes on the path from root node to the
          current mode. </li>
        <li> It takes less time to reach to the goal mode than BFS algorithm (if it traverses in the right path) </li>
        <li> With the help of this we can stordes the route Which is being tracked in memory to save time as it only
          needs to keep one at a particular time. </li><br>
          <h4>DIS ADVANTAGES : </h4>
        <li>There is the possibility that Keep re-occuring, and there is no gurantee of finding the solution. </li>
        <li> DFS algorithm goes for deep down searching and sometime it may go to the infinite loop. </li>
        <li> The depth first search (DFS) algorithm does not always find the shortest path to a solution </li>

      <h3>A TALK BY SHASHI TAROOR. </h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4>This can give you a brief summary about the talk by shashi taroor at oxford university.</h4>
      <br>
      <li> 🇮🇳 Tharoor cites India’s economic decline from 23% to below 4% of global trade during British rule. </li>
      <li> 💰 The British exploited India for resources, financing their Industrial Revolution at India’s expense. </li>
      <li>🏭 Colonial policies dismantled India’s textile industry, leaving weavers impoverished. </li>
      <li> 📜 Reparations principles are likened to other historical precedents, such as Germany’s reparations
        post-WWII.</li>
      <li>🍽️ Starvation in India, exacerbated by British policies during famines, illustrates colonial neglect. </li>
      <li>🚂 British infrastructure was built primarily for colonial interests, not local benefits. </li>
      <li> 🤝 The acknowledgment of historical wrongs is essential for reconciliation and reparations.</li>

        video</a> <br><br>
      <h4>Key Insights</h4><br>
      <li> ⚖️ Colonial Economic Impact: Tharoor illustrates how British colonialism drastically reduced India’s economic
        power, transforming it from a leading exporter to an impoverished nation. This underscores the long-lasting
        effects of exploitation. </li>
      <li> 🏭 Deindustrialization: The dismantling of India’s textile industry highlights how colonial policies were
        designed to benefit Britain rather than the local economy, leading to widespread poverty among skilled artisans.
      </li>
      <li> 📉 Moral Responsibility: Tharoor emphasizes that acknowledging historical injustices is a moral obligation,
        advocating for reparations not just as financial compensation but as recognition of past wrongs. </li>
      <li> 🌍 Global Context: He draws parallels with other nations that have received reparations, reinforcing that
        such actions are not unprecedented and can promote healing and accountability. </li>
      <li> 🥴 Human Cost of Colonialism: The reference to famines and starvation illustrates the human suffering caused
        by colonial policies, challenging the narrative of benevolent governance. </li>
      <li> 🚂 Infrastructure Misuse: The argument that railways were built for British benefit rather than Indian needs
        reveals the exploitative nature of colonial investments, questioning the legacy often celebrated by former
        colonizers. </li>
      <li> 💔 Long-term Consequences: Tharoor’s insights reflect on how colonialism has shaped contemporary issues in
        post-colonial societies, suggesting that reparations could aid in addressing these deep-rooted challenges. </li>
